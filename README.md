# ePortfolio

This repository contains my final ePortfolio for the CS 499 Capstone project. It showcases my growth and expertise as a computer science professional through a collection of enhanced artifacts, reflective narratives, a code review video, and a professional self-assessment.

## Overview

The ePortfolio was developed to demonstrate my mastery in key areas of computer science, including:

- **Software Engineering and Design**
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**
- **Databases and Secure Coding**

Each section of the portfolio highlights the progress made through course projects, reflecting both technical improvements and professional development.

## Contents

- **Artifacts:**  
  - Original and enhanced code files from previous projects.
  - Projects that demonstrate improvements in software design, algorithm efficiency, and secure database practices.

- **Narratives:**  
  - Detailed written reflections for each artifact.
  - Explanations of the enhancement plans, the skills demonstrated, and the challenges overcome during the enhancement process.

- **Code Review Video:**  
  - A walkthrough video that explains the current state of the code, identifies areas for improvement, and outlines the planned enhancements.

- **Professional Self-Assessment:**  
  - A reflective document that introduces my journey through the Computer Science program.
  - An analysis of how my skills and experiences align with my professional goals.

## Navigation

The repository is organized for easy navigation:
- **Artifacts Folder:** Contains all the code files (both original and enhanced).
- **Narratives Folder:** Contains Word documents or PDFs detailing each enhancementâ€™s background and impact.
- **Code Review Video:** A link or embedded file with the video walkthrough.
- **Self-Assessment:** A document that ties together the overall learning experience and career aspirations.

## Original Artifacts

These repositories represent the initial projects that served as the foundation for the enhancements showcased in this ePortfolio.

- **Software Engineering and Design** - These files are located within the file structure of this portfolio.

- **Algorithms and Data Structures:**  
  [CS330_8_2 Repository](https://github.com/jperry82/CS330_8_2)  
  This repository contains my original work for the CS330 course, demonstrating core implementations of algorithms and data structures in computational graphics and visualization.

- **Databases and Secure Coding:**  
  [Perry_Joshua_Module5_EncryptionCoding.zip](https://github.com/jperry82/CS-405_Secure_Coding/blob/main/Perry_Joshua_Module5_EncryptionCoding.zip)  
  This artifact is focused on secure coding practices and encryption techniques applied within a database context, serving as the baseline for further enhancements in database security.
