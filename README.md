# ePortfolio

This repository contains my final ePortfolio for the CS 499 Capstone project. It showcases my growth and expertise as a computer science professional through a collection of enhanced artifacts, reflective narratives, a code review video, and a professional self-assessment.

## Overview

The ePortfolio was developed to demonstrate my mastery in key areas of computer science, including:

- **Software Engineering and Design**  
- **Algorithms and Data Structures**  
- **Databases and Secure Coding**

Each section of the portfolio highlights the progress made through course projects, reflecting both technical improvements and professional development.

## Contents

- **Artifacts:**  
  - Original and enhanced code files from previous projects.
  - Projects that demonstrate improvements in software design, algorithm efficiency, and secure database practices.

- **Narratives:**  
  - Detailed written reflections for each artifact.
  - Explanations of the enhancement plans, the skills demonstrated, and the challenges overcome during the enhancement process.

- **Code Review Video:**  
  - A walkthrough video that explains the current state of the code, identifies areas for improvement, and outlines the planned enhancements.

- **Professional Self-Assessment:**  
  - A reflective document that introduces my journey through the Computer Science program.
  - An analysis of how my skills and experiences align with my professional goals.

## Navigation

The repository is organized for easy navigation:
- **Artifacts Folder:** Contains all the code files (both original and enhanced).
- **Narratives Folder:** Contains Word documents or PDFs detailing each enhancementâ€™s background and impact.
